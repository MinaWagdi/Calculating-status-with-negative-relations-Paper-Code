# Calculating-status-with-negative-relations-Paper-Code
This In this notebook, I am calculating the status scores of each of the monks in the sampson monastery dataset. The results of these calculations were initially in the "Calculating status with negative relations" article by Phillip Bonacich and Paulette Lloyd.   The results found here are Nearly the same as the ones in the paper.  Only one value is different (the one corresponding to JOHN when calculating the status scores in CliqueB using Pos and Neg Results, as explained later) have the same values (with approximation). To feel the difference between both results (the results presented here and the ones in the article), I calculated the euclidean distance between both vectors of status scores.
